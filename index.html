            <h2>Greetings Commander, our future is in your hands!</h2>
            <p>Since the dawn of time, we have always dreamed of walking amongst the stars. 
                Today, that dream is finally a reality! We have you to thank for your monumental efforts leading us in the field of space travel, 
                intergalactic planetary terraforming, and long term cryogenic population control! There is just one small issue. Unfortunately, 
                the moment we announce we are ready to colonize space, so too do the rest of the aliens out there! 
                We don't have any time to waste! We need to get started on sending population craft to other planets! 
                Make sure we are never sent into a negative spacebux(╬) amount, doing so would leave us wide open for alien visitors. You will get 1 
                ╬ every turn, and you can use 5╬ to buy a population craft, you can use 10╬ to launch one. When you want to launch a craft, 
                you can just click on the planet you want to send it to. When the other aliens try to populate our planets we can scramble their craft 
                by buying a radar signal scrambler for 5╬! If you scramble an incoming craft it sends the craft to another planet which will 
                make those planets rivals too! Hitting a rival drains 30╬ from their ╬ bank account so get those crafts moving! There is no 
                limit to how many actions you can take in a turn but remember that you will always have a full turn to scramble an incoming population craft. 
                With this in mind commander, I sure hope you have what it takes to take us to victory! GOOD LUCK!</p>
